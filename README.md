# Midi experiments

## Notes (incomplete, work in progress)

```nimble install naylib```

```nimble install https://github.com/ryback08/naylibgui```

Use [following](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux) instructions to install Linux libs. also ```sudo apt install xorg-dev```.

On Windows, using choosenim ```C:\Users\<username>\.choosenim\toolchains\mingw64\bin``` needs to be in path for the build to work. For some reason it's not there automatically.

Using local copy of ```https://github.com/stoneface86/nim-rtmidi``` for MIDI input.

Modified local copy of ```https://github.com/planetis-m/naygui```
