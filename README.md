# Midi experiments

## Notes

On Windows, using choosenim ```C:\Users\<username>\.choosenim\toolchains\mingw64\bin``` needs to be in path for the build to work. For some reason it's not there automatically.

Using local copy of ```https://github.com/stoneface86/nim-rtmidi``` for MIDI input.

TODO: List all required libraries on Linux for Raylib (naylib) and the rest.
